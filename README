Agitmemnon Server
=================

This is the Agitmemnon Server project.  It provides a read only Git daemon
that gets it's Git data from a Cassandra server loaded by the Ruby Agitmemnon
project.

It is a fork of the Dulwich python/git library that has added in a new data
backend and daemon script for interacting with a Agitmemnon Cassandra 
keyspace.

Setup
==================

Setup is pretty simple - compile and install the modified Dulwich library, 
then run the agit-daemon server script.

 $ cd agitmemnon-server
 $ sudo make install
 $ ./bin/agit-daemon
