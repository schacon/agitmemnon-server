TODO
===============

* Implementation Fixes
   - add real HEAD reference
   - fetches hangup gracefully
   - partial packfile cache usage

* Multi-node Test Environment
   - multi-node project loading/updating
   - benchmark clones
   - x.github.com
   - quick node setup
     - install java, python
     - copy cassandra tarball, conf files, start running it (god?)
   - list of small, public projects to seed

* Web UI
   - check key/values in any of the kepspaces
   - simple browsing UI
   - object API

* Updating System
   - seeding / updating population
     - new github api to get all public repos, last update time / since update time
     - get new/updated repos (from feed)
     - clone/fetch on claiming node
     - run update script
   - re-packcache occasionally
   - keep clone/fetch stats (total time, how many packed/loose objects)

* Large project support
   - split large blobs in object space on insert
   - if the client split up blobs, be able to reconstruct and pack them
   - split long revtree entries
   - reconstruct long revtree entries (possibly done)
